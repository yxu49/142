### 1

If we have two children and one older child is a boy. 
We can know there are four equally probable events: `{BG},{BB},{GB},{GG}`.
Because both of the P{BB, BG} are equally likely, and get only one boy from {BB}, includes two boys. So the probability of the second boy `b` is : 
$$P(BB|b)=P(b|BB) \times \frac {P(BB)} {P(b)} = 1 \times \frac {\frac 1 4} {\frac 1 2}=\frac 1 2$$


### 2

If we have twoi children and know at least one is a bly. Let's the probility of the second boy `B` is :
$$P(BB|B)=P(B|BB) \times \frac {P(BB)} {P(B)} = 1 \times \frac {\frac 1 4} {\frac 3 4}=\frac 1 3$$
